# Car License Plate Detection

This project focuses on detecting car license plates from images using deep learning. The model is trained on a dataset of annotated images to accurately identify and localize license plates in various conditions and environments.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection). It contains images and corresponding XML annotations for the license plate locations.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Detects the presence and location of car license plates in images.
- **Bounding Box Regression**: Outputs bounding boxes around detected license plates.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained models for enhanced performance and faster training.
